####This kinda got away from me

Software is beautiful. I barely understand it, and I know that. The beauty of well-made software  manifests in both form and function – from the individual lines of code to the applications they form. I read code and its purpose flows into me and I am humbled. I write code, and send it out into the world to be read or used or not by my fellows. Together we drop-by-drop fill incredible, awe-inspiring oceans of software. They surround us and engulf us and we swim.

We adapt quickly to these inviting waters. In less than one lifetime we remake ourselves – grow digital webbing between our fingers, and learn to read and ride the strange currents of our creations. We entrust our works to the dark waters. We still come up for air, but these grow shorter as we succumb to the newly ancient call of the sea.

Over time we come to recognize the native life of our new world. Not fish, per-se, but rather undines borrowing that shape. Water swimming through water, distinguished from its surroundings only by a certain uniformity of purpose. We form them and fill them with our desires. Whatever we want to see or know or think or hear or be we simply ask and the incarnate depths deliver.

Our servants grow, change, and adapt to the wills of their varied masters. Some merge and grow into many-limbed leviathans. Some die, their purpose forgotten. We teach some to strain the saltwater for the particulateleft by our relationships and identities. We sustain their near-lives with the intangible substance of our selves. In return, they care for us and buoy us.

Into the strata of our sea we write an ever more bizarre ecosystem.
