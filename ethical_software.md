####This kinda got away from me

Software is beautiful. I barely understand it, and I know that. The beauty of well-made software  manifests in both form and function – from the individual lines of code to the applications they form. I read code and its purpose flows into me and I am humbled. We have drop-by-drop filled ncredible, awe-inspiring oceans of software. They surround us and engulf us and we swim.

We have adapted quickly to these inviting waters. In less than one lifetime we've remade ourselves – grown digital webbing between our fingers, and learned to read and ride the strange currents of our creations. We've trusted our relationships, our works, our lives, to the dark waters. We still come up for air, but these breaks grow shorter as we succumb to the newly ancient call of the sea.

Whatever we want to see or know or think or hear or be we simply ask and the incarnat depths deliver.
